# Homework-02-Portfolio

Our second homework assignment in the Georgia Tech coding bootcamp is to create a student portfolio site that showcases our skills as well as projects we've made.

Things that this portfolio site needs to have are: our name, a recent portrait, and working links to sample projects. Another crucial aspect of this site is that it needs to be made responsively, meaning it maintains a good appearance regardless of what kind of device is viewing it.
